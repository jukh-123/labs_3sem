But sometimes the sounds—like the pain—faded, and then there was only the haze. He
remembered darkness: solid darkness had come before the haze. Did that mean he was
making progress? Let there be light (even of the hazy variety), and the light was good, and
so on and so on? Had those sounds existed in the darkness? He didn’t know the answers to
any of these questions. Did it make sense to ask them? He didn’t know the answer to that
one, either.
The pain was somewhere below the sounds. The pain was east of the sun and south of
his ears. That was all he did know.
For some length of time that seemed very long (and so was, since the pain and the
stormy haze were the only two things which existed) those sounds were the only outer
reality. He had no idea who he was or where he was and cared to know neither. He wished
he was dead, but through the pain-soaked haze that filled his mind like a summer stormcloud, he did not know he wished it.
As time passed, he became aware that there were periods of nonpain, and that these had
a cyclic quality. And for the first time since emerging from the total blackness which had
prologued the haze, he had a thought which existed apart from whatever his current
situation was. This thought was of a broken-off piling which had jutted from the sand at
Revere Beach. His mother and father had taken him to Revere Beach often when he was a
kid, and he had always insisted that they spread their blanket where he could keep an eye
on that piling, which looked to him like the single jutting fang of a buried monster. He
liked to sit and watch the water come up until it covered the piling. Then, hours later, after
the sandwiches and potato salad had been eaten, after the last few drops of Kool-Aid had
been coaxed from his father’s big thermos, just before his mother said it was time to pack
up and start home, the top of the rotted piling would begin to show again—just a peek and
flash between the incoming waves at first, then more and more. By the time their trash
was stashed in the big drum with KEEP YOUR BEACH CLEAN stencilled on the side,
Paulie’s beach-toys picked up
(that’s my name Paulie I’m Paulie and tonight ma’ll put Johnson’s Baby Oil on my
sunburn he thought inside the thunderhead where he now lived) and the blanket folded
again, the piling had almost wholly reappeared, its blackish, slime-smoothed sides
surrounded by sudsy scuds of foam. It was the tide, his father had tried to explain, but he
had always known it was the piling. The tide came and went; the piling stayed. It was just
that sometimes you couldn’t see it. Without the piling, there was no tide.
This memory circled and circled, maddening, like a sluggish fly. He groped for
whatever it might mean, but for a long time the sounds interrupted.
fayunnnn
red everrrrrythinggg
umberrrrr whunnnn
Sometimes the sounds stopped. Sometimes he stopped.
His first really clear memory of this now, the now outside the storm-haze, was of
stopping, of being suddenly aware he just couldn’t pull another breath, and that was all
right, that was good, that was in fact just peachy-keen; he could take a certain level of pain
but enough was enough and he was glad to be getting out of the game.
Then there was a mouth clamped over his, a mouth which was unmistakably a woman’s
mouth in spite of its hard spitless lips, and the wind from this woman’s mouth blew into
his own mouth and down his throat, puffing his lungs, and when the lips were pulled back
he smelled his warder for the first time, smelled her on the outrush of the breath she had
forced into him the way a man might force a part of himself into an unwilling woman, a
dreadful mixed stench of vanilla cookies and chocolate ice cream and chicken gravy and
peanut-butter fudge.
He heard a voice screaming, “Breathe, goddammit! Breathe, Paul!”
The lips clamped down again. The breath blew down his throat again. Blew down it like
the dank suck of wind which follows a fast subway train, pulling sheets of newspaper and
candy-wrappers after it, and the lips were withdrawn, and he thought For Christ’s sake
don’t let any of it out through your nose but he couldn’t help it and oh that stink, that stink
that fucking STINK.
“Breathe, goddam you!” the unseen voice shrieked, and he thought I will, anything,
please just don’t do that anymore, don’t infect me anymore, and he tried, but before he
could really get started her lips were clamped over his again, lips as dry and dead as strips
of salted leather, and she raped him full of her air again.
When she took her lips away this time he did not let her breath out but pushed it and
whooped in a gigantic breath of his own. Shoved it out. Waited for his unseen chest to go
up again on its own, as it had been doing his whole life without any help from him. When
it didn’t, he gave another giant whooping gasp, and then he was breathing again on his
own, and doing it as fast as he could to flush the smell and taste of her out of him.
Normal air had never tasted so fine.
He began to fade back into the haze again, but before the dimming world was gone
entirely, he heard the woman’s voice mutter: “Whew! That was a close one!”
Not close enough, he thought, and fell asleep.
He dreamed of the piling, so real he felt he could almost reach out and slide his palm
over its green-black fissured curve.
When he came back to his former state of semiconsciousness, he was able to make the
connection between the piling and his current situation—it seemed to float into his hand.
The pain wasn’t tidal. That was the lesson of the dream which was really a memory. The
pain only appeared to come and go. The pain was like the piling, sometimes covered and
sometimes visible, but always there. When the pain wasn’t harrying him through the deep
stone grayness of his cloud, he was dumbly grateful, but he was no longer fooled—it was
still there, waiting to return. And there was not just one piling but two; the pain was the
pilings, and part of him knew for a long time before most of his mind had knowledge of
knowing that the shattered pilings were his own shattered legs.
But it was still a long time before he was finally able to break the dried scum of saliva
that had glued his lips together and croak out “Where am I?” to the woman who sat by his
bed with a book in her hands. The name of the man who had written the book was Paul
Sheldon. He recognized it as his own with no surprise.
“Sidewinder, Colorado,” she said when he was finally able to ask the question. “My
name is Annie Wilkes. And I am—”
“I know,” he said. “You’re my number-one fan.”
“Yes,” she said, smiling. “That’s just what I am.”
Darkness. Then the pain and the haze. Then the awareness that, although the pain was
constant, it was sometimes buried by an uneasy compromise which he supposed was
relief. The first real memory: stopping, and being raped back into life by the woman’s
stinking breath.
Next real memory: her fingers pushing something into his mouth at regular intervals,
something like Contac capsules, only since there was no water they only sat in his mouth
and when they melted there was an incredibly bitter taste that was a little like the taste of
aspirin. It would have been good to spit that bitter taste out, but he knew better than to do
it. Because it was that bitter taste which brought the high tide in over the piling
(PILINGS it’s PILINGS there are Two okay there are two fine now just hush just you
know hush shhhhhh)
and made it seem gone for awhile.
These things all came at widely spaced intervals, but then, as the pain itself began not to
recede but to erode (as that Revere Beach piling must itself have eroded, he thought,
because nothing is forever—although the child he had been would have scoffed at such
heresy), outside things began to impinge more rapidly until the objective world, with all
its freight of memory, experience, and prejudice, had pretty much re-established itself. He
was Paul Sheldon, who wrote novels of two kinds, good ones and best-sellers. He had
been married and divorced twice. He smoked too much (or had before all this, whatever
“all this” was). Something very bad had happened to him but he was still alive. That darkgray cloud began to dissipate faster and faster. It would be yet awhile before his numberone fan brought him the old clacking Royal with the grinning gapped mouth and the
Ducky Daddles voice, but Paul understood long before then that he was in a hell of a jam.
That prescient part of his mind saw her before he knew he was seeing her, and must surely
have understood her before he knew he was understanding her—why else did he associate
such dour, ominous images with her? Whenever she came into the room he thought of the
graven images worshipped by superstitious African tribes in the novels of H. Rider
Haggard, and stones, and doom.
The image of Annie Wilkes as an African idol out of She or King Solomon’s Mines was
both ludicrous and queerly apt. She was a big woman who, other than the large but
unwelcoming swell of her bosom under the gray cardigan sweater she always wore,
seemed to have no feminine curves at all—there was no defined roundness of hip or
buttock or even calf below the endless succession of wool skirts she wore in the house
(she retired to her unseen bedroom to put on jeans before doing her outside chores). Her
body was big but not generous. There was a feeling about her of clots and roadblocks
rather than welcoming orifices or even open spaces, areas of hiatus.
Most of all she gave him a disturbing sense of solidity, as if she might not have any
blood vessels or even internal organs; as if she might be only solid Annie Wilkes from
side to side and top to bottom. He felt more and more convinced that her eyes, which
appeared to move, were actually just painted on, and they moved no more than the eyes of
portraits which appear to follow you to wherever you move in the room where they hang.
It seemed to him that if he made the first two fingers of his hand into a V and attempted to
poke them up her nostrils, they might go less than an eighth of an inch before
encountering a solid (if slightly yielding) obstruction; that even her gray cardigan and
frumpy house skirts and faded outside-work jeans were part of that solid fibrous
unchannelled body. So his feeling that she was like an idol in a perfervid novel was not
really surprising at all. Like an idol, she gave only one thing: a feeling of unease
deepening steadily toward terror. Like an idol, she took everything else.
No, wait, that wasn’t quite fair. She did give something else. She gave him the pills that
brought the tide in over the pilings.
The pills were the tide; Annie Wilkes was the lunar presence which pulled them into his
mouth like jetsam on a wave. She brought him two every six hours, first announcing her
presence only as a pair of fingers poking into his mouth (and soon enough he learned to
suck eagerly at those poking fingers in spite of the bitter taste), later appearing in her
cardigan sweater and one of her half-dozen skirts, usually with a paperback copy of one of
his novels tucked under her arm. At night she appeared to him in a fuzzy pink robe, her
face shiny with some sort of cream (he could have named the main ingredient easily
enough even though he had never seen the bottle from which she tipped it; the sheepy
smell of the lanolin was strong and proclamatory), shaking him out of his frowzy, dreamthick sleep with the pills nestled in her hand and the poxy moon nestled in the window
over one of her solid shoulders.
After awhile—after his alarm had become too great to be ignored—he was able to find
out what she was feeding him. It was a pain-killer with a heavy codeine base called
Novril. The reason she had to bring him the bedpan so infrequently was not only because
he was on a diet consisting entirely of liquids and gelatines (earlier, when he was in the
cloud, she had fed him intravenously), but also because Novril had a tendency to cause
constipation in patients taking it. Another side-effect, a rather more serious one, was
respiratory depression in sensitive patients. Paul was not particularly sensitive, even
though he had been a heavy smoker for nearly eighteen years, but his breathing had
stopped nonetheless on at least one occasion (there might have been others, in the haze,
that he did not remember). That was the time she gave him mouth-to-mouth. It might have
just been one of those things which happened, but he later came to suspect she had nearly
killed him with an accidental overdose. She didn’t know as much about what she was
doing as she believed she did. That was only one of the things about Annie that scared
him.
He discovered three things almost simultaneously, about ten days after having emerged
from the dark cloud. The first was that Annie Wilkes had a great deal of Novril (she had,
in fact, a great many drugs of all kinds). The second was that he was hooked on Novril.
The third was that Annie Wilkes was dangerously crazy.
No more, please. I don’t want to look at any more. I’ve got the idea. I’m going to put
this book down exactly where I found it. Then I am going into my room. I guess I don’t
want to write after all; I think I’ll just take an extra pill and go to bed. Call it nightmare
insurance. But no farther down Annie’s Memory Lane, if you please. Please, if you please.
But his hands seemed to have a mind and a will of their own; they kept on turning the
pages, faster and faster.
Two more brief death notices in the Union-Leader, one in late September of 1969, one
in early October.
March 19th, 1970. This one was from the Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Herald. A back
page. NEW HOSPITAL STAFF ANNOUNCED. There was a photo of a balding,
bespectacled man who looked to Paul like the type of fellow who might eat boogers in
secret. The article noted that in addition to the new publicity director (the balding,
bespectacled fellow), twenty others had joined the staff of Riverview Hospital: two
doctors, eight R.N.’s, assorted kitchen staff, orderlies, and a janitor.
Annie was one of the R.N.’s.
On the next page, Paul thought, I am going to see a brief death notice for an elderly
man or woman who expired at Riverview Hospital in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
Correct. An old duffer who had died of that all-time favorite, Long Illness.
Followed by an elderly man who had died of that perennial bridesmaid, Short Illness.
Followed by a child of three who had fallen down a well, sustained grievous head
injuries, and been brought to Riverview in a coma.
Numbly, Paul continued to turn the pages while the wind and rain drove against the
house. The pattern was inescapable. She got a job, killed some people, and moved on.
Suddenly an image came, one from a dream his conscious mind had already forgotten,
which thus gained the delphic resonance of déjà vu. He saw Annie Wilkes in a long
aproned dress, her hair covered with a mobcap, an Annie who looked like a nurse in
London’s Bedlam Hospital. She held a basket over one arm. She dipped into it. Brought
out sand and flung it into the upturned faces she passed. This was not the soothing sand of
sleep but poisoned sand. It was killing them. When it struck them their faces went white
and the lines on the machines monitoring their precarious lives went flat.
Maybe she killed the Krenmitz kids because they were brats … and her roommate …
maybe even her own father. But these others?
But he knew. The Annie in him knew. Old and sick. All of them had been old and sick
except Mrs. Simeaux, and she must have been nothing but a vegetable when she came in.
Mrs. Simeaux and the kid who had fallen down the well. Annie had killed them because—
“Because they were rats in a trap,” he whispered.
Poor things. Poor poor things.
Sure. That was it. In Annie’s view all the people in the world were divided into three
groups: brats, poor poor things… and Annie.
She had moved steadily westward. Harrisburg to Pittsburgh to Duluth to Fargo. Then, in
1978, to Denver. In each case the pattern was the same: a “welcome aboard” article in
which Annie’s name was mentioned among others (she had missed the Manchester
“welcome aboard” probably because, Paul guessed, she hadn’t known that local
newspapers printed such things), then two or three unremarkable deaths. Following these,
the cycle would start again.
Until Denver, that was.
At first, it seemed the same. There was the NEW ARRIVALS article, this time clipped
from the in-house newspaper of Denver’s Receiving Hospital, with Annie’s name
mentioned. The in-house paper was identified, in Annie’s neat hand, as The Gurney.
“Great name for a hospital paper,” Paul told the empty room. “Surprised no one thought of
calling it The Stool Sample.” He donkeyed more terrified laughter, all unaware. Turned the
page, and here was the first obit, cut from the Rocky Mountain News. Laura D. Rothberg.
Long illness. September 21st, 1978. Denver Receiving Hospital.
Then the pattern broke wide open.
The next page announced a wedding instead of a funeral. The photo showed Annie, not
in her uniform but in a white dress frothing with lace. Beside her, holding her hands in his,
was a man named Ralph Dugan. Dugan was a physical therapist. DUGAN-WILKES
NUPTIALS, the clipping was headed. Rocky Mountain News, January 2nd, 1979. Dugan
was quite unremarkable save for one thing: he looked like Annie’s father. Paul thought if
you shaved off Dugan’s singles-bar moustache—which she had probably gotten him to do
as soon as the honeymoon was over—the resemblance would be just short of uncanny.
Paul thumbed the thickness of the remaining pages in Annie’s book and thought Ralph
Dugan should have checked his horoscope—whoops, make that horrorscope—the day he
proposed to Annie.
I think the chances are very good that somewhere up ahead in these unturned pages I
am going to find a brief article about you. Some people have appointments in Samarra; I
think you may well have had one with a pile of laundry or a dead cat on a flight of stairs.
A dead cat with a cute name.
But he was wrong. The next clipping was a NEW ARRIVALS from the Nederland
newspaper. Nederland was a small town just west of Boulder. Not all that far from here,
Paul judged. For a moment he couldn’t find Annie in the short, name-filled clipping, and
then realized he was looking for the wrong name. She was here, but had become part of a
socio-sexual corporation called “Mr. and Mrs. Ralph Dugan.”
Paul’s head snapped up. Was that a car coming? No … just the wind. Surely the wind.
He looked back down at Annie’s book.
Ralph Dugan had gone back to helping the lame, the halt, and the blind at Arapahoe
County Hospital; presumably Annie went back to that time-honored nurse’s job of giving
aid and comfort to the grievously wounded.
Now the killing starts, he thought. The only real question is about Ralph: does he come
at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end?
But he was wrong again. Instead of an obit, the next clipping showed a Xerox of a
realtor’s one-sheet. In the upper left corner of the ad was a photo of a house. Paul
recognized it only by the attached barn—he had, after all, never seen the house itself from
the outside.
Beneath, in Annie’s neat firm hand: Earnest money paid March 3rd, 1979. Papers
passed March 18th, 1979.
Retirement home? Paul doubted it. Summer place? No; they couldn’t afford the luxury.
So …?
Well, maybe it was just a fantasy, but try this. Maybe she really loves old Ralph Dugan.
Maybe a year has passed and she still can’t smell cockadoodie on him. Something has sure
changed; there have been no obituaries since—
He flicked back to see.
Since Laura Rothberg in September 1978. She stopped killing around the same time she
met Ralph. But that was then and this is now; now the pressure is starting to build up
again. The depressive interludes are coming back. She looks at the old people … the
terminally ill … and she thinks about what poor poor things they are, and maybe she
thinks, It’s this environment that’s depressing me. The miles of tiled corridor and the
smells and the squeak of crepe-soled shoes and the sounds of people in pain. If I could get
out of this place I’d be all right.
So Ralph and Annie had apparently gone back to the land.
He turned the page and blinked.
Slashed into the bottom of the page was AUG 23rd 1980 FUCK YOU!
The paper, thick as it was, had torn in several places under the fury of the hand which
had driven the pen.
It was the DIVORCES GRANTED column from the Nederland paper, but he had to
turn it over to make sure that Annie and Ralph were a part of it. She had pasted it in upside
down.
Yes, here they were. Ralph and Anne Dugan. Grounds: mental cruelty.
“Divorced after a short illness,” Paul muttered, and again looked up, thinking he heard
an approaching car. The wind, only the wind … still, he’d better get back to the safety of
his room. It wasn’t just the worsening pain in his legs; he was edging toward a state of
terminal freak-out.
But he bent over the book again. In a weird way it was just too good to put down. It was
like a novel so disgusting you just have to finish it.
Annie’s marriage had been dissolved in a much more legal fashion than Paul had
anticipated. It seemed fair to say that the divorce really had been after a short illness—a
year and a half of wedded bliss wasn’t all that much.
They had bought a house in March, and that was not a step you took if you felt that your
marriage was falling apart. What happened? Paul didn’t know. He could have made up a
story, but a story was all it would have been. Then, reading the clipping again, he noticed
something suggestive: Angela Ford from John Ford. Kirsten Frawley from Stanley
Frawley. Danna McLaren from Lee McLaren. And …
Ralph Dugan from Anne Dugan.
There’s this American custom, right? No one talks about it much, but it’s there. Men
propose in the moonlight; women file in court. That’s not always how it works, but usually
that’s it. So what tale does this grammatical structure have to tell? Angela’s saying “Slip
out the back, Jack!” Kirsten is saying “Make a new plan, Stan!” Danna is saying “Drop
off the key, Lee!” And what was Ralph, the only man who’s listed first in this column,
saying? I think maybe he was saying “Let me the hell out of here!”
“Maybe he saw the dead cat on the stairs,” Paul said.
Next page. Another NEW ARRIVALS article. This one was from the Boulder,
Colorado, Camera. There was a photograph of a dozen new staff members standing on the
lawn of the Boulder Hospital. Annie was in the second row, her face a blank white circle
under her cap with its black stripe. Another opening of another show. The date underneath
was March 9th, 1981. She had retaken her maiden name.
Boulder. That was where Annie really had gone crazy.
He turned the pages faster and faster, his horror mounting, and the two thoughts which
kept repeating were Why in God’s name didn’t they tip faster? and How in God’s name did
she slip through their fingers?
May 10th, 1981—long illness. May 14th, 1981—long illness. May 23rd—long illness.
June 9th—short illness. June 15th—short. June 16th—long.
Short. Long. Long. Short. Long. Long. Short.
The pages stuttered through his fingers. He could smell the faint odor of dried paperpaste.
“Christ, how many did she kill?”
If it was right to equate each obituary pasted in this book with a murder, then her score
was more than thirty people by the end of 1981 … all without a single murmur from the
authorities. Of course most of the victims were old, the rest badly hurt, but still… you
would think …
In 1982 Annie had finally stumbled. The clipping from the January 14th Camera
showed her blank, stonelike face rendered in newsprint dots below a headline which read:
NEW HEAD MATERNITY WARD NURSE NAMED.
On January 29th the nursery deaths had begun.
Annie had chronicled the whole story in her meticulous way. Paul had no trouble
following it. If the people after your hide had found this book, Annie, you would have been
in jail—or some asylum—until the end of time.
The first two infant deaths had not aroused suspicion—a story on one had mentioned
severe birth defects. But babies, defective or not, weren’t the same as old folks dying of
renal failure or carcrash victims brought in still somehow alive in spite of heads which
were only half there or steering-wheel-sized holes in their guts. And then she had begun
killing the healthy along with the damaged. He supposed that, in her deepening psychotic
spiral, she had begun to see all of them as poor poor things.
By mid-March of 1982 there had been five nursery deaths in the Boulder Hospital. A
full-scale investigation was launched. On March 24th the Camera named the probable
culprit as “tainted formula.” A “reliable hospital source” was cited, and Paul wondered if
perhaps the source had not been Annie Wilkes herself.
Another baby had died in April. Two in May.
Then, from the front page of the June 1st Denver Post:
HEAD MATERNITY NURSE QUESTIONED ON INFANT DEATHS
No Charges Made “As Yet,” Sheriff’s Office Spokeswoman Says
By Michael Leith
Anne Wilkes, the thirty-nine-year-old head nurse of the maternity ward at Boulder
Hospital, is being questioned today about the deaths of eight infants—deaths which have
taken place over a span of some months. All of the deaths took place following Miss
Wilkes’s appointment.
When asked if Miss Wilkes was under arrest, Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman Tamara
Kinsolving said she was not. When asked if Miss Wilkes had come in of her own free will
to give information in the case, Ms. Kinsolving replied: “I would have to say that was not
the case. Things are a bit more serious than that.” Asked if Wilkes had been charged with
any crime, Ms. Kinsolving replied: “No. Not as yet.”
The rest of the article was a rehash of Annie’s career. It was obvious that she had moved
around a lot, but there was no hint that people in all of Annie’s hospitals, not just the one
in Boulder, had a way of croaking when she was around.
He looked at the accompanying photograph, fascinated.
Annie in custody. Dear God, Annie in custody; the idol not fallen but teetering…
teetering …
She was mounting a set of stone steps in the company of a husky policewoman, her face
dull, devoid of expression. She was wearing her nurse’s uniform and white shoes.
Next page: WILKES RELEASED, MUM ON INTERROGATION.
She’d gotten away with it. Somehow, she’d gotten away with it. It was time for her to
fade out and show up someplace else—Idaho, Utah, California, maybe. Instead, she went
back to work. And instead of a NEW ARRIVALS column from somewhere farther west
there was a huge headline from the Rocky Mountain News front page of July 2nd, 1982:
The Horror Continues:
THREE MORE INFANT DEATHS IN BOULDER HOSPITAL
Two days later the authorities arrested a Puerto Rican orderly, only to release him nine
hours later. Then, on July 19th, both the Denver Post and the Rocky Mountain News
announced Annie’s arrest. There had been a short preliminary hearing in early August. On
September 9th she went on trial for the murder of Girl Christopher, a female child one day
of age. Behind Girl Christopher were seven other counts of first-degree murder. The
article noted that some of Annie’s alleged victims had even lived long enough to be given
real names.
Interspersed among the accounts of the trial were Letters to the Editor printed in the
Denver and Boulder newspapers. Paul understood that Annie had been driven to cull only
the most hostile ones—those which reinforced her jaundiced view of mankind as Homo
brattus—but they were vituperative by any standards. There seemed to be a consensus:
hanging was too good for Annie Wilkes. One correspondent dubbed her the Dragon Lady,
and the name stuck for the duration of the trial. Most seemed to feel that the Dragon Lady
should be jabbed to death with hot forks, and most indicated they would be very willing to
serve as a jabber.
Beside one such letter Annie had written in a shaky and somehow pathetic script
entirely unlike her usual firm hand: Sticks stones will break my bones words will never
hurt me.
It was apparent that Annie’s biggest mistake had been not stopping when people finally
realized something was going on. It was bad, but, unfortunately, not quite bad enough. The
idol only tottered. The prosecution’s case was entirely circumstantial, and in places thin
enough to read a newspaper through. The district attorney had a hand-mark on Girl
Christopher’s face and throat which corresponded to the size of Annie’s hand, complete
with the mark of the amethyst ring she wore on the fourth finger of her right hand. The
D.A. also had a pattern of observed entries and exits to the nursery which roughly
corresponded to the infant deaths. But Annie was the head maternity nurse, after all, so
she was always going in and out. Defense was able to show dozens of other occasions
when Annie had entered the ward and nothing untoward had happened. Paul thought this
was akin to proving that meteors never struck the earth by showing five days when not a
single one had hit Farmer John’s north field, but he could understand the weight the
argument would have carried with the jury just the same.
The prosecution wove its net as well as it could, but the handprint with the mark of the
ring was really the most damning bit of evidence it could come up with. The fact that the
State of Colorado had elected to bring Annie to trial at all, given such a slight chance of
conviction on the evidence, left Paul with one assumption and one certainty. The
assumption was that Annie had said things during her original interrogation which were
extremely suggestive, perhaps even damning; her attorney had managed to keep the
transcript of that interrogation out of the trial record. The certainty was that Annie’s
decision to testify in her own behalf at the preliminary hearing had been extremely
unwise. That testimony her attorney hadn’t been able to keep out of the trial (although he
had nearly ruptured himself trying), and while Annie had never confessed to anything in
so many words during the three days in August she had spent “up there on the stand in
Denver,” he thought that she had really confessed to everything.
Excerpts from the clippings pasted in her book contained some real gems:
Did they make me feel sad? Of course they made me feel sad, considering the world we
live in.
I have nothing to be ashamed of. I am never ashamed. What I do, that’s final, I never
look back on that type of thing.
Did I attend the funerals of any of them? Of course not. I find funerals very grim and
depressing. Also, I don’t believe babies are ensouled.
No, I never cried.
