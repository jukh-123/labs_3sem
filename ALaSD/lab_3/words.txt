But sometimes the sounds—like the pain—faded, and then there was only the haze. He
remembered darkness: solid darkness had come before the haze. Did that mean he was
making progress? Let there be light (even of the hazy variety), and the light was good, and
so on and so on? Had those sounds existed in the darkness? He didn’t know the answers to
any of these questions. Did it make sense to ask them? He didn’t know the answer to that
one, either.
The pain was somewhere below the sounds. The pain was east of the sun and south of
his ears. That was all he did know.
For some length of time that seemed very long (and so was, since the pain and the
stormy haze were the only two things which existed) those sounds were the only outer
reality. He had no idea who he was or where he was and cared to know neither. He wished
he was dead, but through the pain-soaked haze that filled his mind like a summer stormcloud, he did not know he wished it.
As time passed, he became aware that there were periods of nonpain, and that these had
a cyclic quality. And for the first time since emerging from the total blackness which had
prologued the haze, he had a thought which existed apart from whatever his current
situation was. This thought was of a broken-off piling which had jutted from the sand at
Revere Beach. His mother and father had taken him to Revere Beach often when he was a
kid, and he had always insisted that they spread their blanket where he could keep an eye
on that piling, which looked to him like the single jutting fang of a buried monster. He
liked to sit and watch the water come up until it covered the piling. Then, hours later, after
the sandwiches and potato salad had been eaten, after the last few drops of Kool-Aid had
been coaxed from his father’s big thermos, just before his mother said it was time to pack
up and start home, the top of the rotted piling would begin to show again—just a peek and
flash between the incoming waves at first, then more and more. By the time their trash
was stashed in the big drum with KEEP YOUR BEACH CLEAN stencilled on the side,
Paulie’s beach-toys picked up
(that’s my name Paulie I’m Paulie and tonight ma’ll put Johnson’s Baby Oil on my
sunburn he thought inside the thunderhead where he now lived) and the blanket folded
again, the piling had almost wholly reappeared, its blackish, slime-smoothed sides
surrounded by sudsy scuds of foam. It was the tide, his father had tried to explain, but he
had always known it was the piling. The tide came and went; the piling stayed. It was just
that sometimes you couldn’t see it. Without the piling, there was no tide.
This memory circled and circled, maddening, like a sluggish fly. He groped for
whatever it might mean, but for a long time the sounds interrupted.
